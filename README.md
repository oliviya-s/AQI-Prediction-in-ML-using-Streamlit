# AQI Prediction in ML using Streamlit

This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning, based on air quality parameters like PM2.5, PM10, SO₂, and NO₂. The model is built with scikit-learn and visualized using a Streamlit web application.

## Files
- **AQI.py**: Python script containing the machine learning model (Linear Regression) and Streamlit app code.
- **cpcb_dly_aq_odisha-2015_with_aqi.csv**: Dataset with air quality data from Odisha, 2015.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `streamlit`

Install them with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit
